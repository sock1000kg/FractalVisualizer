# Fractal Visualizer
*(English | [Tiếng Việt](./README.vi.md))*
[Live Demo](https://sock1000kg.github.io/FractalVisualizer/) (currently only works on PC)

Fractal Visualizer is a CPU-based fractal visualizer built with HTML5 and JavaScript using the Julia set. Explore a wide variety of mesmerizing patterns, zoom in to discover intricate details, and save your favorite fractals. Customize colors, coordinates, and more in the advanced settings to unleash your creativity. Have fun :)

## Features
- Interactive fractal drawing using mouse position and hue shifts
- Zoom
- Black and White mode
- Download fractal images
- Save and delete presets
- Simple mode for lower performace machines

## Planned features
- WebGL based rendering (reduce lag)
- Different types of fractals
- Allow users to control the fractal's depth (the number of iterations)

## Credits
I saw Carter Semrad's "I coded one project EVERY WEEK for a YEAR" and was very inspired and curious about his fractal generation project, so I decided to try and build one from scratch with my own added features.
